4DGeo is a modular web-based dashboard application for visualizing geospatial data over time. Built with React, it enables users to interact with and analyze 4D geodata (spatial and temporal) using various visualization modules. The project is designed to be flexible and extendable, making it easy to adapt for different use cases such as landslide detection, insect monitoring, and other environmental observations.

You can access a hosted version of the dashboard [here](https://3dgeo-heidelberg.github.io/4DGeo/).

## Get started in 2 minutes: Visualize your point clouds

To show how easy it is to visualize your data with a 4DGeo dashboard, we've prepared a short [Python Notebook](getting_started.ipynb) tutorial. It demonstrates how a series of point clouds can be prjected into images and displayed within the dashboard.

The process involves just two simple steps:

- **Prepare your data:** Convert your list of images into the 4DGeo [data model](Application.md#21-data-model)
- **Configure your dashboard:** Either load a predefined layout or create your own with our [dashboard creation page](Application.md#1-creation-page)


##  Online documentation

Thorough online documentation on the dashboard can be found [here](https://3dgeo-heidelberg.github.io/4DGeo/docs). Feel free to use the notebook implementation examples as a starting point, and remember to cite this repository.
